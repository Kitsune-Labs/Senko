<@&962822738349813831> **Version: 1.8.8**

> **Senko**

— A lot of backend changes and additions

> **Updated Commands**

— **shop** - Senko's market has been updated and now multiple users can buy items directly from it instead of using `/buy` (one step closer to daily shop refreshes!) ~~Who knows, maybe it'll be out in the next update?~~
