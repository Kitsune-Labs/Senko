- New changing status like before. (Changes every 120 minutes)

## Shop
- Refreshed
- New christmas themed items

## New Commands

- `configuration`
- `banner`

#### Configuration
- You now have the ability to change your profile to "private" or "public"

#### Banner
I've been trying to figure out how I can go about this, and now I have an answer!
- A dropdown menu will appear and you can select a new banner to equip from your inventory
- It will show you what is currently equipped

#### Color
Similar to the banner command, except it's for colors.

## Updated Commands
- `OwOify`
- `WhoIs`
- `avatar`

#### OwOify
- Fixed

#### WhoIs
- Removed "bannable" "kickable" and "manageable" as it's from Senko's POV (might come back later but from the user's POV)

#### avatar
- Updated colors to use the color palette


## What to see in the future

- Automatic shop refresh
- New images on certain commands
- Equipable titles
