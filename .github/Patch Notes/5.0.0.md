I'm excited to announce the arrival of version 5! There aren't many small changes or additions in this version but it does have a big change...

Version 5 marks the day Senko has been rewritten in typescript!

I have also reverted the removal of the timestamp in the deleted message embed
And finally, a new domain has been created for Senko and can be found at https://senko.gg/ !
Finally, an issue with timeout logs has also been fixed
