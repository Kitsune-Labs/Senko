@Senko Updates **Weekly Version Update: 1.7.1**

:warning: This update includes Guild breaking changes

> **Senko**
The way guild data was handled previously has been stripped and replaced with a new system, this will allow Senko to now do things like:

— Have moderation commands like /warn, /ban, and /kick
— The ability to log messages for server administrators
— The ability to use the filter from Senko's World! in your own server with your own custom words
— A welcoming system with a fully customizable message
— A verification system like what Senko's World! has with your message and button choice
+ Many more guild features

:Tick:  ***Note: These are not actually implemented yet***


Senko's way of handling her permissions has also been updated, this includes a new message when she is missing permissions and a performance improvement for command running
