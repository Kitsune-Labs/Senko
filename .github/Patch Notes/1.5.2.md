# MISC
```diff
- Senko will be offline for a little bit
```

# Senko

- **Backend**
— Remade backend for **/config** which will remove the use of manual editing, therefore "no" errors
— Updated backend for **/manga** so it wont throw errors

# Commands

- **Eat** — Instead of doing nothing but give yen, and the lack of anything to do with food items, you can now eat the items you buy from Senko's Market! This will use a random food item that is in your inventory

- **OwOify** — Remade owoification module

- **config**
— **title** - Updated "current title" message to "No Title" if you do not have a title equipped
— **color** - Updated "current color" message to show the color name instead of the color value
