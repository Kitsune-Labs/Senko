<h1> Patch 0.6.0

## A new patch has appeared!

- Almost every command has been modified, whether this is frontend or backend.

- Senko now checks for self-permissions!

No longer will you wonder why a command is not working due to not having the right permission, if Senko doesn't have permission it will notify you with the permission(s) it needs!
(*note: Will be expanded in the future*)

- Several command responses have been changed to be more friendly!

- Fixed info link for "Invite Senko"

- Increased general performance

- TAGS!

Tags are now a thing but aren't fully finished, currently being used for some commands.

- New backend API
